# Sabbath Bot
It's a bot.
It tries to help children survive [the sabbath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath).
Because the sabbath can be hard.

The frontend is Elm.
Because I love Elm.

The backend incorporates [the Microsoft Bot Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/).
Because maybe that will be helpful.
